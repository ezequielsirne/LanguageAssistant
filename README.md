# LanguageAssistant

This project is a chatbot designed to facilitate English language practice by using the GPT API to simulate conversations in English. The main goal of this application is to offer users a platform for daily English language skill enhancement, allowing them to engage in lifelike Dialogues as part of their practice routine. Notably, the application features an integrated error correction mechanism to provide users with feedback on any linguistic errors made during their practice sessions. You can try it by clicking on view demo.

This app is built entirely using React and JavaScript. For a deeper insight into the technical implementation, you can explore the full source code of the app on the GitHub repository.
